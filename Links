Google Home Mini telling a Raspberry Pi 2 to control LEDs.
Accomplished using IFTTT Webhooks service and a custom Python Webserver running on Rasbian.

This is a basic introduction for myself into this. This will be built upon in the future, but for now it is just a proof of concept.

Great tutorial on Flask, and setting up a web server on a Raspberry Pi:

You will need to forward a port through your firewall to make this work 
 on your internal network. That process is different for every brand of router, please refer to your devices manual.

Create a "this" trigger based on Googe Assistant service
I used the GA trigger "Say a phrase with both a number and a text ingredient"
What do you want to say?
    Set kitchen lights to # and $
Create a "that" action based on Webhooks service
URL (replace with your public IP and web server port used by Flask):
    XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX:YYYY/brightnessColor?led=NumberField&color=TextField
